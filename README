CallistoPBX
===========

This software is being developed to replace several billing products used by Microcom Communications, Liberty Telecom, and Brute Technologies.

Primary Focus
-------------

- Replace A2Billing software currently in use for Liberty Telecom for wholesale and calling card access.

- Replace custom configuration directories used for Asterisk PBX installation - CallistoPBX should help maintain and create a full fledged PBX with finer grain reporting facilities

- Replace recording devices for quality assurance
